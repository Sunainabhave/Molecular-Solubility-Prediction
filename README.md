# Molecular Solubility Prediction
Molecular Solubility Prediction

This project predicts aqueous solubility (LogS) of molecules using molecular descriptors from the Delaney ESOL dataset. The goal is to compare the performance of different regression models in predicting molecular solubility.

Models Used

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Dataset

Delaney ESOL dataset

Contains molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds, aromatic proportion, and the target solubility (LogS).

How to Run

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the notebook Molecular_Solubility_Prediction.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter and run all cells.

Notes

The notebook includes training, prediction, and visualization of results.

The best-fit line is plotted to compare predicted vs. actual values.
